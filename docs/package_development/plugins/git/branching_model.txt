===========================
The Domogik branching model
===========================

Overview
========

For any Domogik package on git, you should follow the branching model described here : http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Basically :
* the *master* branch contains the last stable release
* the *develop* branch contains the release which is currently developped. It you have to do any upgrade or fix, you should do them in this branch.
* when a development release is ready (in the *develop* branch), you merge it in the *master* branch and put a tag for the release in the *master* branch.
