!PLCBUS plugin
{maketoc}

!!Purpose
Plcbus is an automation technology wich allows to switch and dim lights, control appliances, etc. This plugin allows to control plcbus devices. 

Following interfaces are supported :
* PLCBUS-1141U  

!!Prerequisite
!!!Ubuntu/Debian installation
To use the plcbus plugin, you need the python serial package. To install it, launch this command :
{CODE()}
sudo apt-get install python-serial
{CODE}
!!How to plug

Simply plug the interface into some USB port, and on the power line.
{img fileId="189" thumb="y" rel="box[g]" title="Plcbus Interface" alt="Plcbus Interface"} 

!!!Permissions management
To give access to everybody on your computer to the Plcbus interface and have a **/dev/plcbus** entry point, follow these instructions.

First, get vendor and product ids :
{CODE()}
$ lsusb
...
Bus 005 Device 002: ID 067b:2303 Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303 Serial Port
...
{CODE}

Here, vendor id is 067b and product id is 2303.

Create an udev rule for Plcbus in file **/etc/udev/rules.d/plcbus.rules** :
{CODE()}
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="067b", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2303", SYMLINK+="plcbus", MODE="0666"
{CODE}

You then just have to unplug and plug back your PLCBUS interface to have permissions on it as a non root user. Your interface will always have a symlink /dev/plcbus, no matter what the real device is.
!!Plugin configuration
!!!Enabling the plugin
You can enable the plugin by using :
{CODE()}
dmgenplug plcbus
{CODE}

You just have to reload the administration page in Domogik to see the plugin in the list.

!!!Configuration
In Domogik administration, go to the plcbus configuration page.

{img fileId="186" thumb="y" rel="box[g]" title="Plcbus configuration example"} 

!!!!device
Path to Plcbus interface
Default : /dev/plcbus

!!!!usercode
The user code you want to use in your house. You can safely keep the default value or choose your own one. It is only really usefull if you have more than 255 plcbus items or if your neighbours also have plcbus devices.

||TODO : example of usercode or allowed values||
!!!!probe-interval
To detect changes made by other controllers than Domogik (remotes, switches, etc), Domogik uses fastpolling. It also helps to discover new devices. You can start setting this value to 5 seconds and then adapt it to your needs.
The plugin will do a fastpoll every **probe-interval** seconds. In fact, it uses 2 commands : 

* First do a "GET_ALL_ID_PULSE", to detect all devices.
* Then do a "GET_ALL_ON_ID_PULSE", to detect the state of all devices.

It is much faster than the STATUS_REQUEST order, because you ask all the devices in one house using only 1 message.

||TODO : example values||
!!!!probe-list
The plugin will scan devices in all housecodes indicated by this field. If you know you only have devices with housecodes "A" and "B", then only keep "AB" in this field, so that the plugin won't scan other roomcodes.
!!!!Save your configuration
Just hit the button and wait the "configuration saved succesfully" message.
!!!!Start the plugin
You can now start the plugin (start button).
!!Creating Plcbus devices
||TODO : complete following||

!!!Affect an address to a PLCBus module
||TODO : create a device with a given address, affect feature, use feature for ON, check...||

!!!Creating a lamp device

In the administration panel, go to **Organization > Devices** page. Create a new device like this :
* Name : Short name, like "Hall"
* Address : A3 (for example)
* Description : Device details, like "Hall light"
* Reference : Plcbus module's model, only for informations, like "PLCBUS-2221"
* Usage : "Light"
* Type : 
** plcbus.switch provides only on/off
** plcbus.dimmer provides on/off and dim/bright.

Examples :

{IMG(attId="190")}{IMG}   {IMG(attId="191")}{IMG}

((Setup_your_devices|Attribute the features to a place and you will be able to control your lamp.))

!!!Creating an appliance device
In the administration panel, go to **Organization > Devices** page. Create a new device like this :
* Name : Short name, like "Swimming pump"
* Description : Swimming pool motor pump
* Address : A3
* Reference : PLC2268HX2
* Type : PLCBus.Switch
* Usage : "Appliance" (for example)

((Setup_your_devices|Attribute the features to a place and you can now control your appliance.))

!!Helpers
*To get an introduction to helpers, you can read the ((Plugins_helpers|Helper documentation)). To use a helper, the plugin must be stopped.*

!!!Discover your devices - plcbus all <home code> <user code>
To check if your device are correctly plugged or if your interface is able to see them, you may use the **plcbus all** helper. The interface parameter is not mandatory (by default it uses "/dev/plcbus"), you just have to use this command.
After about 10 seconds, a result like this should be displayed :

{img fileId="258" thumb="y" rel="box[g]" desc="in this example \"A\" is my Home Code and \"00\" is my User Code! " title="In this example \"A\" is my Home Code and \"00\" is my User Code ! "} 
{CODE()}$ plcbus all A 00
A1 on
A2 on
A3 off
A4 off
{CODE}
As you can see in this example you can also see the device status.
!!Developper Notes

!!!xPL schema
No official xPL Schema exists for Plcbus. A dedicated schema has been made for this feature.
[http://xplproject.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=908&|Discussion on official xPL Forum about this xPL schema]

!!!!xpl-cmnd
{CODE()}
PLCBUS.BASIC
{
USERCODE=<plcbus network usercode>
DEVICE=<sensor name>
COMMAND=<value sent to the device>
[ACK=<0|1>]
[DATA1=<additional data>]
[DATA2=<additional data>]
}
{CODE}

This sends a command to the plcbus plugin. The usercode used is always the same in one house (it only changes if we manage a plcbus system in many houses near from each others). ACK may be ignored if not usable with the defined COMMAND.

||TODO : explain more Usercode and Device (with examples)||
||TODO : check if ACK is used or not||
||TODO : list of available COMMAND values||
||TODO : DATA1 and DATA2 : description of usage||

!!!!xpl-stat
{CODE()}
PLCBUS.BASIC
{
USERCODE=<plcbus network usercode>
DEVICE=<device name>
COMMAND=<value sent to the device>
[DATA1=<additional data>]
[DATA2=<additional data>]
}
{CODE}

It is used to send a message when a command is received *from* the plcbus network (for ex, is sent by a remote).

||TODO : a remote sending should be a trig! Check it in code||

!!!!xpl-trig
{CODE()}
PLCBUS.BASIC
{
USERCODE=<plcbus network usercode>
DEVICE=<device name>
COMMAND=<value sent to the device>
ACK=1
[DATA1=<additional data>]
[DATA2=<additional data>]
}
{CODE}

This is used to send an acknowledge when an ack command is received.
||TODO : and maybe also when an event is received||

!!!!Command

Manual command example, assuming your usercode is "FF"

First go to ~/domogik/src/domogik/xpl/bin/

* Turn ON A1 :
{CODE()}./send.py xpl-cmnd plcbus.basic "device=A1,command=ON,usercode=FF"{CODE}

* Turn OFF A1 :
 {CODE()}./send.py xpl-cmnd plcbus.basic "device=A1,command=OFF,usercode=FF"{CODE}

* Preselect Dimmer to 40% on A1 :
{CODE()}./send.py xpl-cmnd plcbus.basic "device=A1,command=PRESET_DIM,usercode=FF,data1=40"{CODE}

* Preselect Dimmer to 40% with 3 secondes Fade Rate on A1 :
{CODE()}./send.py xpl-cmnd plcbus.basic "device=A1,command=PRESET_DIM,usercode=FF,data1=40,data2=3"{CODE}

* Preselect No Fade Rate on A1 :
{CODE()}./send.py xpl-cmnd plcbus.basic "device=A1,command=PRESET_DIM,usercode=FF,data2=0"{CODE}

*Turn ALL Ligths OFF :
{CODE()} ./send.py xpl-cmnd plcbus.basic "command=ALL_LIGHTS_OFF"{CODE}

*Turn ALL Ligths ON :
{CODE()} ./send.py xpl-cmnd plcbus.basic "command=ALL_LIGHTS_ON"{CODE}

* /command/plcbus/<address>/dim/<value>
* /command/plcbus/<address>/bright/<value>
