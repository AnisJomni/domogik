==========
X10 plugin
==========

Purpose
=======

X10 is an automation technology which allows to switch and dim lights, control appliances, etc.
This plugin allows to control X10 devices if you got a **CM11** / **CM12** adaptator.
If you want to use another adaptator, check if there are available plugins for these adaptators.

.. note::
    at this day (august 2010), creating a plugin for CM15 is planned, so CM15 support is only a question of time.

How to plug
===========

On the left the CM12DK module which is used to send commands to all x10 plugged in modules.
On the right a LM12 module used to control a lamp.

Heyu
====
This plugin uses `Heyu <http://www.heyu.org>`_ as an external tool to use CM11 adaptator.
As said on Heyu's homepage, *Heyu is a text-based console program for remotely controlling lights and appliances at home or office*.
So, you will first need to install Heyu.

Prepare
-------
Create or edit /etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules, and add: ::

    KERNEL=="ttyUSB*",DRIVERS=="pl2303",SYMLINK+="cm11",MODE="0666"

*MODE* sets the rights on the device. In this case everybody is allowed to send a command to it.
By default only root can do it. As you probably won't start Domogik as root...

Then, plug in your CM11 device. You should have a /dev/cm11 link created: ::

    $ ls -l /dev/cm11 
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 2010-07-19 09:50 /dev/cm11 -> ttyUSB3

Note that "ttyUSB3" may change on your installation.

Installation
------------
Get the last sources (eventually adapt the following line) and uncompress them: ::

    $ wget http://www.heyu.org/download/heyu-2.9.3.tar.gz
    $ tar xzf heyu-2.9.3.tar.gz
    $ cd heyu-2.9.3/

Lauch sources compilation: ::

    $ ./Configure
    $ make

Launch installation with root user (or as sudo): ::

    $ make install

* Choose "3. In directory /etc/heyu  (for system-wide access)"
* Answer "/dev/cm11" to the question "To which port is the CM11 attached ?"

Checking installation
---------------------

Get heyu information
********************

Launch this command: ::

    $ heyu info

You should obtain something like: ::

    Heyu version 2.8.0
    Configuration at /etc/heyu/x10.conf
    Powerline interface on /dev/cm11
    Firmware revision Level = 8
    Interface battery usage = Unknown
    Raw interface clock: Mon, Day 199, 08:58:50
    (--> Civil Time: Mon 19 Jul 2010   09:58:50 CEST)
    No schedule has been uploaded by Heyu.
    Housecode = A
    0 = off, 1 = on,               unit  16.......8...4..1
    Last addressed device =       0x0000 (0000000000000000)
    Status of monitored devices = 0x0000 (0000000000000000)
    Status of dimmed devices =    0x0000 (0000000000000000)

Try using an appliance
**********************

Plug in an appliance device (using A1 code for example) and run: ::

    $ heyu on A1

The appliance should switch on. Now run: ::

    $ heyu off A1

The appliance should switch off.

Try using a lamp 
****************
Plug in a lamp device (using A2 code for example) and run: ::

    $ heyu on A2

The lamp should switch on. Now, run (one or more times): ::

    $ heyu dim A2 10 

This command lowers brightness of 10 units each time you call it.
So, your lamp intensity should decrease. Now, run: ::

    $ heyu bright A2 10 

This command increases brightness of 10 units each time you call it. So, your lamp intensity should increase.

Finally, run: ::

    $ heyu off A2
    $ heyu stop

Plugin configuration
====================

Enabling plugin
---------------

You can enable plugin by using (from your domogik directory): ::

    $ dmgenplug x10_heyu

You just have to reload administration page to see the plugin in the list.

Configuration
-------------
In the administration panel, go to x10_heyu configuration page.

heyu-cfg-path
*************
Path to Heyu config file
Default : /etc/heyu/x10.conf
The default value (/etc/heyu/x10.cfg) should be fine. When set don't forget to save it!

Start the plugin
----------------
You can now start the plugin (start button).

Creating x10 devices
====================

Creating a lamp device
----------------------
In the administration panel, go to **Organization > Devices** page. Create a new device like this :

*   Name : Short name, like "Hall"
*   Description : Device details, like "Hall light"
*   Address : X10 address, like "A4"
*   Reference : X10 module's model, only for information, like "LM12"
*   Type : 
    * X10.switch (provides only on/off)
    * X10.dimmer (provides on/off and dim/bright)
* Usage : Light

Example : 

.. image:: x10_create_dimmer.png
.. image:: x10_create_switch.png

:doc:`Attribute the features to a place </enduser/configuration/devices>` and you can now control your lamp.

Creating an appliance device
----------------------------
In administration, go to **Organization > Devices** page. Create a new device like this :

* Name : Short name, like "Coffee machine"
* Description : Describe your coffee machine if you want!
* Address : X10 address, like "A3"
* Reference : X10 module's model, only for information, like "AM12"
* Type : X10.switch
* Usage : Appliance

:doc:`Attribute the features to a place </enduser/configuration/devices>` and you can now control your appliance.

Developper Notes
================

xPL schema
----------

The `x10.basic <http://xplproject.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Schema_-_X10.BASIC>`_ schema is used.

/command
--------

.. code-block:: none

    /command/x10/<address>/on # switch on the lamp / appliance
    /command/x10/<address>/off # switch off the lamp / appliance

*Only for lamps* 

.. code-block:: none

    /command/x10/<address>/dim/<value> # dim units by <level> (1-22) (decrease brightness)
    /command/x10/<address>/bright/<value> # brighten units by <level> (1-22) (increase brightness)

Note that these values are relative.
