Pub/sub detailed informations

plugin.configuration
====================

Publisher: 
* all Domogik plugins

Subscriber: any member who wants to be aware of the plugins configuration updates
* manager
* UIs

When a plugin configuration is updated (add, delete, update actions), the dbmgr published over the MQ a message.

An example to catch these messages is available as *src/domogik/examples/mq-python/sub_plugin_configuration.py*.

You will get messages like this: ::

    {"host": "darkstar", "type": "plugin", "id": "diskfree", "event": "updated"}

The only *event* value is *updated*.

In the *manager*, a *Plugin* object is created for each plugin detected (on the file system). In each of these objects, a subscription is made to the *plugin.configuration* category and when a message is catched, if *type == 'plugin' and id == <plugin id> and host = <hostname>* then the plugin configuration in database is reloaded (in order the *clients.detail* message to be updated)


plugin.status
=============

Publisher: 
* all Domogik plugins

Subscriber: any member who wants to be aware of the plugins status
* manager
* UIs

Each domogik plugin sends over the MQ its status. The manager subscribe to the category *plugin* to get the plugin status in real time.

For example, on plugin startup (see XplPlugin.__init__()), a plugin sends the *STATUS_STARTING* (*starting* value): ::

    self._pub.send_event('plugin.status',
                         {"type" : "plugin",
                          "id" : self._name,
                          "host" : self.get_sanitized_hostname(),
                          "event" : STATUS_STARTING})

An example to catch these messages is available as *src/domogik/examples/mq-python/sub_plugin_status.py*.

You will get messages like this: ::

    {"host": "darkstar", "type": "plugin", "id": "diskfree", "event": "alive"}

Find here `:doc:the full list of available status.</technical/plugins/index>`

In the *manager*, a *Plugin* object is created for each plugin detected (on the file system). In each of these objects, a subscription is made to the *plugin.status* category and when a message is catched, if *type == 'plugin' and id == <plugin id>* then the plugin status is set to the catched value.


clients.list

Publisher: 
* manager

Subscriber: any member who wants to be aware of the clients (plugins, ...) list
* UIs

You will get messages like this: ::

    {"domogik-diskfree.darkstar": {"status": "alive", "configured": true, "pid": 0, "host": "darkstar", "type": "plugin", "id": "diskfree"}}

clients.detail
==============
