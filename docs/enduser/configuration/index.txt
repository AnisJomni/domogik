====================
First use of Domogik
====================

Purpose
=======
In this page we will present you the different screens and sections of Domogik. If you already use Domogik you can directly go to ((Create_and_configure_your_house|the next page)).

Accessing to the Domogik web UI
===============================
At the end of the installation the installer script should have displayed this information :

* Administrator login
* Administrator password
* Domogik web UI url

So you should be now able to access to the Domogik web UI :)

Screens description
===================
Home screen description
-----------------------
The first time you access Domogik you should see an information notification which tells you that there is no area or room yet created :

.. image:: no_area_or_room.png

On the top of the screen you will get :

* **Domogik banner**.
* **Main menu**.

Under the main menu there are :

* On the left, the **widgets zone** of the house.
* On the right, the **different places** of your house ordered by areas. If you get rooms directly linked to your house they will appear before areas.
