Your house
==========
The first thing to do in Domogik is to configure your house or your flat.
In this documentation we will use the **house** term to design a house a flat or whatever place you could live in.

Here is the architecture choosen in Domogik to separate your house in several areas: ::

    | House | => | Areas* | => | Rooms |

optionnal*

Example of a house with several areas
-------------------------------------
A house is often made of several **areas**.
An area can be a floor, a "day" zone (with kitchen, living room, etc), a "night" zone with all bedrooms, the garden, the garage, the cellar, a swimming pool area, etc.
Often you won't have the same needs in automation for theses different areas so separating them is a good idea to get a better access to automation commands and data.
In an area you will have **rooms**. Sometimes it could be not exactly rooms (in your swimming pool area you could have the swimming pool and a deck).

A typical house example with basement, groundfloor and one floor :

Example of a house with no area
-------------------------------
If you live in a small flat or if you don't want to separate your house in several areas, you could obtain this architecture :

Configure your house
====================
To configure your house you will have to go to the **administration** panel and follow the following steps.

1. Go to **Organisation > House** section to :doc:`define your house name </enduser/administration/house>`.
2. Go to **Organisation > Area** section to :doc:`create your different Areas </enduser/administration/area>` (If you don't want/need any area, go to the next step).
3. Go to **Organisation > Room** section to :doc:`create your different Rooms </enduser/administration/room>`. In this section you will also be able to put your rooms into areas.

Right now if you go back to the **Visualisation** mode, you should see your house.
