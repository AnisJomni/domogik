Quick overview

What is Domogik in several words ?
==================================

Domogik is a free home automation solution. It allows to use several User Interfaces (you can even create your own interface if you are willing to).
It is modular : you can add and remove plugins easily and create your own plugins. A plugin is based on a technology (or part of a technology).

.. note::
    In :doc:`Release 0.1.0 </releases/0.1.0>`, the plugin format is not fixed. So we provide existing plugins already installed (x10, PLCBus, 1-wire...).
    Domogik will really be fully modular in following releases.

How does it work ?

RINOR
-----
RINOR is a kind of gateway server between User Interfaces, database and xPL world. It allows to :

* read and write data from / to the database
* listen to xPL network and send xPL commands
* record statistics
* start, stop and configure plugins
* provide the REST API server for UIs

User Interface
--------------
As an end user, you will only use one of the available User Interfaces (at the moment there are a Web UI and an Android app).
All UIs will need to access the REST API server to communicate with the Domogik core. REST is the ''ONLY'' entry point for all UI interactions (for database access, xPL communication or everything else an UI needs and REST allows).

xPL
---

.. epigraph::

    xPL is an open protocol intended to allow the control and monitoring of home automation devices. The primary design goal of xPL is to provide a rich set of features and functionalities, whilst maintaining an elegant, uncomplicated message structure. The protocol includes complete discovery and auto-configuration capabilities which support a fully 'plug and play' architecture essential to ensure a good end-user experience.
    xPL benefits from a strongly-specified message structure, required to ensure that xPL-enabled devices from different vendors are able to communicate without the risk of incompatibilities.

Database
--------
The database is used in two ways : 

* directly by RINOR (request of room list, devices...)
* when plugins ask for their configuration. The configuration is stored in the database but plugins do not have a direct access to it (this is required for modularity purposes). So the database can provide the configuration to plugins by communicating over the xPL network (in fact RINOR asks the database to retrieve this information).

Plugins
-------
Plugins (X10, 1wire, Plcbus, etc) are standalone and can only communicate over the xPL network. This is the key of modularity.

Web UI
------
Domogik's Web UI supports the latest HTML5 and CSS features. We decided to comply with this in order to give customers the best experience possible with a Web UI. But this choice implies that you won't be able to use Domogik Web UI with older browsers. 

If your browser doesn't support all HTML5 features used by Domogik, you will get this kind of notification :

We recommend you to use browsers like Firefox, Chrome (Chromium) or any other that respects the latest web standards.
