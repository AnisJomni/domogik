Manager
=======

Purpose
=======
The manager is used to automatically start core components and eventually plugins at its startup. Then he will check the plugins status and wait for a command.

You can call it with *dmg_manager*.

Design
======
The plugins manager is a xPL plugin (heritates of *domogik.xpl.common.plugin.XplPlugin*).
When it starts, it connects to the xPL network and wait for messages.

Depending on the options passed at startup, it will be able to start: ::

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d                    Start database manager if not already running.
  -r                    Start scenario manager if not already running.
  -p                    Activate background ping for all plugins.
  -E                    This manager is the one who looks for hardware.
  -t CUSTOM_PING_DURATION
                        Time for xpl ping duration (default : 10)
  -w WAIT_TIME_BETWEEN_PING
                        Time between 2 xpl ping (default : 15)
  -V, --version         Display Domogik version.
  -f                    Run the plugin in foreground, default to background.


It will then wait and listen for *domogik.system* and *domogik.package* xPL command messages.

Auto-refresh the enabled plugins list
=====================================
When the Domogik configuration file is updated, the manager reloads it (so there is no need to restart the manager after enabling a plugin).
