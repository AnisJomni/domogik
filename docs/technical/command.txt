.. warning ::

    All the actuators are not listed in this page. This page purpose is to give some examples.

A command is an action that can be done on a device, like switching it on or off, setting the dimmer value, ...
The opposit of a command is a :doc:`Sensor </technical/sensor>`.
Note that some devices can be both. Typically this is the case of a thermostat which can be controled and can send back a value (the temperature).

A command is defined in the the plugin :doc:`json file </package_development/json_file>`, on device creation the commands devined in the plugin json file and linked to the to create device type will be inserted in the DB. A command can be executed by calling a rest url :doc:`/cmd </technical/rinor/rest_command.txt>`.

A command can have parameters that are required to successfully execute the command, typically the result of a widget.

In the 0.4 release a command has a one on one relationship with an xplcommand, an xplcommand is the part thats sent in the background to make a plugin do an action/command.

A command has a list of required parameters that are needed to handle it, for example to set the level on a dimmer the command needs a level to set the dimmer, this, this level parameter is a required parameter to be able to complete the command.
