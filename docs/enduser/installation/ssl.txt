Activate ssl for REST
=====================

Generate the certificate 
------------------------

First, generate a self-signed certificate compounded of a certificate and a private key for your REST server with the following command (both certificate and key are put in a single file : domogik.pem): ::

    $ openssl req -new -x509 -keyout domogik.pem -out domogik.pem -days 365 -nodes

This certificate is valid for one year. Adapt the *days* parameter (-days 365) to change this.

Configure REST
