AUDIO.MPRIS Message Specification
Class = AUDIO
Type = MPRIS

This schema provides an easy way of interacting with MPRIS capable audio
players. Each command corresponds to one of the MPRIS method.

XPL-CMND Structure

XPL-CMND messages will be used to send command request. All commands are
defined to correspond to one MPRIS method name.

AUDIO.MPRIS
{
	COMMAND=<command>[<parameters>]
}

Where commands are :
NAME 			MPRIS relation 			Arguments
=================================================
IDENTITY 		Identity 				No
QUIT 			Quit 					No
VERSION 		MprisVersion 			No
LISTMETADATA 	Tracklist.GetMetadata	Item position
CURRENTTRACK 	GetCurrentTrack 		No
LENGTH 			GetLength 				No
ADDTRACK 		AddTrack 				Track uri, should be played immediately
DELTRACK 		DelTrack 				Track position
SETLOOP 		SetLoop 				True/False
SETRANDOM 		SetRandom 				True/False
NEXT 			Next 					No
PREVIOUS 		Prev 					No
PAUSE 			Pause 					No
STOP 			Stop 					No
PLAY 			Play 					No
REPEAT 			Repeat 					True/False
STATUS   		GetStatus 					No
PLAYERMETADATA  Player.GetMetadata 		No
CAPACITIES 		GetCaps 				No
SETVOLUME 		VolumeSet 				Volume level [0;100]
VOLUME 			VolumeGet 				No
SETPOSITION 	PositionSet 			Position in the track in milliseconds
POSITION 		PositionGet 			No



XPL-TRIG Structure

Triggers will be used to transmit MPRIS "signals". These signals should be
emitted when the player state change. 

AUDIO.MPRIS
{
	COMMAND=<command>[<parameters>]
}

The signals can be :

NAME 				MPRIS Relation 			Arguments
=====================================================
TRACKCHANGE 		TrackChange 			metadata
STATUSCHANGE 		StatusChange 			new status
CAPABILITIESCHANGE 	CapsChange 				new capabilities
TRACKLISTCHANGE 	TrackListChange 		number of ellemnts in the new
tracklist



XPL-STAT Structure

Stat message should be used to send data resulting from some xpl-cmnd previous
message. The key name will correspond to the command previously called, and the
value will correspond to the data returned. Available key names are :

NAME 				MPRIS Relation
==================================
IDENTITY 			Identity
VERSION 			MprisVersion
METADATA 			GetMetadata
CURRENTTRACK 		GetCurrentTrack
LENGTH 				GetLength
ADDTRACK 			AddTrack
STATUS 				GetStatus


Plus, the hbeat message :
HBEAT.BASIC
{
	INTERVAL=5
}
