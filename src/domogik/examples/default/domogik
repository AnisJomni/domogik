# This file defines config parameters for domogik

#Start domogik daemon under this user
DOMOGIK_USER=domogik

# This variable can take 2 parameters :
# -d to start the database manager
# -r to start the rest component
# Remember : Your domogik installation must have *one* and *only one*
# instance of the database manager and the rest manager running
# Your domogik installation won't start on this computer if :
#  - The database manager is not already running elsewhere on the network
#  - You do not pass -d parameter to the manager
MANAGER_PARAMS="-d -r"

# You can define one or many extra path(s) for Domogik startup scripts.
# This should only be useful if you use Domogik in developement mode (with setup.py develop)
# or if you have a custom path install.
# PATH is needed to locate 3 applications :
#  - django : a script to run the domogik's ui, installed by setup.py develop
#  - xPL_Hub : the xPL hub, *not* installed by setup.py develop
#  - dmg_manager : Domogik's manager, installed by setup.py develop
