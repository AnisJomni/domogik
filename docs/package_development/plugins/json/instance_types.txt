============================================
info.json for plugins - instance_types section
============================================

Purpose
=======

The instance_types section describes all the instance types that are handled by the plugin. An *instance type* is a sort of device (for example an analog input, a digital input, a temperature sensor, a temperature and humidity sensor, ...). 
An instance type is linked to some *commands* and some *sensors*. For example, a temperature sensor will have only a temperature  sensor. A temperature and humidity sensor will have 2 sensors : a temperature sensor and a humidity sensor. In some technologies, an on/off lighting instance type will have 1 command : on/off (which may be named switch) and a dimmer instance type will have 2 commands: on/off (switch) and dimmer (which could be simply named dimmer).
Finally an instance type has some parameters. For simple instance type, there will be only one parameter : the device address. For some complex instance type (some KNX or Chacon devices for example), you will have several parameters : the address which is split in 2 parts (chacon devices), the actuator address which is not the same as the sensor one (KNX devices), ...

The known datatypes can be found in /var/lib/domogik/resources/datatypes.json.

Example 1
=========

This example is the *diskfree* plugin. This plugin has only one instance type named *diskfree.disk_usage*. This instance type feature is to look at the disk space status on a filesystem. There are 4 informations which are available for this feature: 

* the total space available
* the free space available
* the used space 
* the percent of space used

These 4 informations are here given by 4 sensors.

To check these sensors the plugin need 2 information for the instance type:

* the path to look at on the filesystem
* the interval between each check

Description
-----------

* *id* : this is the instance type id
* *name* : the instance type name
* *description* : a short description of the instance type
* *commands* : the list of commands supported by this instance type
* *sensors* : the list of sensors supported by this instance type
* *parameters* : list of parameters that are common to ALL xpl messages for this instance type

  * *key* : the xpl key for the message
  * *xpl* : is this an xpl parameter or nit, if set to true this parameter will be included in the xplcommands and expected in the xplstats/triggers, if set to false it will only be availble internal in domogik or in the plugin if it requests the devices
  * *description* :  short description of this field
  * *type* : the value type for this field. The available values are the same as the oens used in the :doc:`configuration part of the json <configuration>`
  * depending on the type the are other posibilitys (like min_value, max_value, ....)
