How to find and install a package
=================================

Where are the packages ?
========================

Well, as 0.4.0 is not really a full end user release there are still some features missing. The main feature missing is the packages management as you can did it with Domogik 0.2 or Domogik 0.3.

As the packages format has been changed, we have also changed the tools related to the packages. Currently, there is a tool to install a package but there is no website to list all the available packages.

Keep also in mind that during 0.4.0, packages are being migrated to the new format, so there may be not all the packages you are looking for today ;).

You can ask us on the mailing list, irc or forum to keep you informed.


When will I be able to easily find packages ?
=============================================

In Domogik 0.4.1 we will work on the website which will list the packages. So, the 0.4.1 (or maybe 0.4.2) should be the target release.
