===================
Plugin library part
===================


TODO : "helpers" for special pages


Purpose
=======

The library part of a plugin can be the first step of your plugin. It you write it in the good way, this library may be usable out of Domogik!

In most cases, a library will contain a class. This class will have a constructor, some functions for actuators features (these functions will be called from the binary part when some xPL messages are catched), some functions for the sensor part (in most cases, it will be an eternal loop to listen to the hardware or to call some services). The sensor functions will be able to send xPL messages by calling some callback functions which refers to functions in the binary part.

Template
========

TODO

TODO : callback
TODO : inifinite loop
TODO : timer



Focus on the logs
=================

You already learned how to use the log functions in the :doc:`the bibrary part documentation <bin_part>`. Let's see how to do this in the library part.

TODO


Focus on xPL : send xPL messages and listen for xPL messages
============================================================

Send xPL messages
-----------------

TODO : callback

Listen for xPL messages
-----------------------

As explained in the binary part, there is nothing to do in the library about catching some xPL messages. The xPL messages are catched in the binary part, they are analysed and to finish, some functions or methods from the library are directly called from the binary part. So, you just need to prepare the needed function with the parameters you need and call these functions from the binary part.
