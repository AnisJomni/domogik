xPL is a message-based distributed system. It allows process to cummunicate using
simple text messages. Message specification is defined by schemas. Lot of schemas 
are already defined by the xPL Project [1].
Anyway, Domogik needs some functionnality which are *not* described in any schema.
This directory contains schema definitions. Each schema is decribed as in the xPL projet.

## Template :
<Class>.<type> Message Specification

    * Class = <Class>
    * Type = <type>

This schema provides basic information relating to <short description>

=== XPL-TRIG Structure ===
<Class>.<Type>
{
KEY1=<value format or description>
KEY2=<value format or description>
[OPTIONAL_KEY3=<value format or description>]
}
=== XPL-CMND Structure ===

<Class>.<Type>
{
KEY1=<value format or description>
KEY2=<value format or description>
[OPTIONAL_KEY3=<value format or description>]
}

=== XPL-STAT Structure ===


HBEAT.*
{

}

or

<Class>.<Type>
