========================================
Standard installation on debian (Jessie)
========================================

Installation
============

.. note::
    * These examples assume you are using Debian or another apt-based distribution (Ubuntu, etc).  Adjust accordingly (eg, use yum instead if using RedHat-based distribution).
    * Domogik includes its own xPL hub.  If you are running another xPL hub on your target machine (xpl-perl, etc), you will have to deactivate it before installation.
    * In this example, we use a *mysql* database. If you want to use a *postgresql* database, please refer to :doc:`the specific installations steps for postgresql <postgresql>`.

Dependencies
------------

Install Python and setuptools

    $ sudo apt-get install python python-setuptools pip

.. note::
    We assume want you use mysql database.

Download Domogik
----------------

.. warning::
    You must put Domogik sources in a folder which can be read by all the system users and the domogik user. For example, be carefull if you extract domogik sources in */home/john/domogik* and you choose the *domogik* user during installation : the *domogik* user must have write access to */home/john/domogik*.
    
    * don't download Domogik sources in */root* or */*

.. note::
   Please keep in mind that the folder which will be used to get the sources will be the one used by Domogik installation. So please put it in a proper folder (the following command lines will use **/opt/**).

Use git to get the sources (be sure that your user is able to create some directories where you will clone the sources): ::

    $ sudo apt-get install git
    $ cd /opt/
    $ git clone https://github.com/domogik/domogik.git
    $ cd domogik
    $ git checkout master

Install Domogik 
---------------

Since Domogik 0.4, there is no more *install.sh* file. Now you must use the *install.py*: ::

    $ cd /opt/domogik/
    $ sudo ./install.py --dist-packages --create-database

.. note:: 
    --dist-packages option will automaticaly install debian package dependency with apt-get tool.
    --create-database option will automaticaly try to create domogik database and give all privilege to domogik in on it.

.. note::
   Domogik uses a configuration file which is created and configured by the *install.py* script. This file is */etc/domogik/domogik.cfg*. For more informations, please read :doc:`the page related to the configuration file <domogik_cfg_file>`.
.. note:: 

    During installation, a new user will be created if necessary.
    
    If you want to use the C xPL hub instead of the python xPL hub, you need to update manually the configuration after Domogik installation. See :doc:`here </xplhub/index>` for more informations on the xpl hub.

.. todo::
    Describe all the steps


Make Domogik start with your computer
-------------------------------------

For Debian systems: ::

    $ sudo update-rc.d domogik defaults

Start domogik
-------------

::

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/domogik start
    * Starting 0MQ broker ... Done.
    * Starting 0MQ forwarder ... Done.
    * Starting xPL (python version)... Done.
    * Starting Manager (with -d -r -x -s)... Done.
    * Starting the admin interface ... Done.

It will start : 

* The 0MQ broker and forwarder
* The xpl hub
* The Domogik manager on this host
* The database manager and the REST interface module (which will take in account the parameters you defined in your configuration file : host, IP...)
* The administration web interface

Next step : domoweb, the web user interface
-------------------------------------------

Domoweb is not yet available for Domogik 0.4

It doesn't work?
----------------
