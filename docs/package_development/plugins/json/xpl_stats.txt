=========================================
info.json for plugins - xpl_stats section
=========================================

Purpose
=======

The xpl_stats section will describe all xPL messages that may be received by some sensors. No difference is made between *xpl-stat* and *xpl-trig* messages : as some xpl client implement these messages not as required in the xPL specification, we process them in the same (this is not an issue as basically xpl-trig and xpl-stat contains the same data : xpl-trig is just used for events and data changes and xpl-stat for all other usages).

Example 1
=========

This example is the *diskfree* plugin. See the :doc:`device types documentation <device_types>` for more informations.

Description
-----------

Here there is 4 sorts of xpl messages that may be received. Each one has its proper subsection here: 

* "get_percent_used": {...}
* "get_used_space": {...}
* "get_total_space": {...}
* "get_free_space": {...}

The key used is free and you can put anything you want. In this plugin, each sensor has its own xpl message, so we choose to use for this key the name of the related sensor. This key will be inserted in database only for reference (it is not used, it is just in the database to help for debugging to find the related data in the json file).

For each message you need to set:

* *name*: it will be displayed in the user interface when you will configure a widget.
* *schema*: the xPL schema used by the plugin.
* *parameters*: all the parameters of the xPL message.

  * *static*: all the static keys of the xPL message. Static keys will always be the same, whatever the device is. They will never be displayed in the user interface.
  * *device* : the static parameters. Their value is defined on a per device basis (input is requested) in the user interface. The values can be different for the *xpl_commands* and xpl_stats* parts (if both exists).
  * *dynamic* : all the dynamic parts of the xPL message. It is all the keys which are not related to the device address : values for the sensors. They are stored in the sensor history table.
