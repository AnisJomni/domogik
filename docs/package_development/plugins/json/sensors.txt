info.json for plugins - sensors section
=======================================

Purpose
=======

The sensors section will quickly describe each sensor with:

* a name
* a data type. See :doc:`the data types documentation <../data_types/index>` for more informations
* if needed, some conversion options


Example 1
=========

This example is the *diskfree* plugin. See the :doc:`device types documentation <device_types>` for more informations.

For each sensor, we define a name and no conversion option. Then, depending of the sensor we use 2 data types:

* DT_Byte : this one is used for values in byte, which are the values returned by the sensors *get_free_space*, *get_used_space* and *get_total_space*.
* DT_Scaling is used for values in percent from 0 to 100, which corresponds to the value returned by the sensor *get_percent_used*.

        "sensors": {
            "get_total_pace": {
                "name": "Total Space",
                "data_type": "DT_Byte",
                "conversion": "",
                "incremental": false,
                "history": {
                    "store": true,
                    "duplicate": false,
                    "max": 0,
                    "expire": 0,
                    "round_value": 0
                }
            },
            ...
        }

Description
===========

Each item has several properties: 

* **name** : it is a string used to display this sensor on the UI
* **data_type** : the data type used for this sensor
* **incremental** : if set to True, store the difference between the last value and the current value, check the incremental section for more info.
* **conversion** : if not an empty string, what conversion function to call before storing the value in the db, the function should return the data in the format acording to the data_type. More informations in the :doc:`conversion chapter </package_development/plugins/conversion/index>`.
* **history** : some extra parameters that can be used to define what to store in the history table
    * **store** : can be True or False, if True the values will be stored in the sensor_history table
    * **max** : max number of records that will be stored in the history table, if 0 the max number is infinate.
    * **expire** : how long the history needs to be kept, if 0 the stats will bekept forever. Its counted in days, so a value of 10 means keep the history for 10 days.
    * **round_value** : a number that will be used for the reduced stats storage. This will only be evaluated if tstore is True
    * **duplicate** : if set to true, duplicate values following each other will be stored, if set to false this will not happen

.. note::
    The values in the subsection history can be adapted after sensor creation, the changes will be visible in the sensor_history table once a new value is stored for that sensor.

.. note::
    If a sensor is set as incremental its not a good idea to set round_value to anythign different then 0. This could result in corrupt data in the sensor_history table.

What happens if a sensor value needs to be store
================================================

1. Check that the value is not in the ignore_values list of a xpl stat parameter, else abort the store process.
2. If a conversion is defined for this sensor, run the conversion code, the next steps will happen on the converted value.
3. If the incremental value is set, the difference between the received value and the last stored value is calculate, the result will be sued in the next steps.
4. If the duplicate flag is set to false, and the last stored value is the same as the value at the end of step 3, abort the storage of this value
5. If round_value is set, check if we need to store this value (check the round value section for more info).
6. If store is set to true and the value is not the same as the previous stored value, store the value in the sensor_history table. If store is set to False the sensor history table will not be updated, only the last_value on the sensor will be udpated.
7. If max is bigger then 0, delete all oldes values in the sensor_history table intul we only have 'max' num of items in taht table
8. If expire is bigger then 0, delete all entries in the sensor_history table that are older then 'expire' num of days.


Incremental explanation
=======================
The parameter is used for sensors like a kWH sensor, these sensors typically send over an absolute value, if we would store this value we would just get a climing chart, so the charts would not be representative. To solve this we intruduced the incremental sensor type.

This means that only the difference between the last stored value will be stored, to explain it exactly w'll work with an example.

For a sensor that has incremental set tue, the following values are received:
1. 10
2. 11
3. 12
4. 15
5. 16
6. 18

So on the receival of the first value, incremental will just keep this value in memory, so it can calculate the diffrence on the next received values.

On step 2 we will store the difference between the value received on step 1 and the one received in step 2, so we will store 1.
The same happens on all the next steps. As a result we will get the folowing stored values:
1. 0
2. 1
3. 1
4. 3
5. 1
6. 2

This will result in a chart that will really display the used kWH during the time period between the 2 steps.

Round Value explanation
=======================
The round value is used to reduce the number of stored history values.

As an example why this would be needed:
Some device can collect data every 10 seconds, in 24 hours, the device can collect 8640 items a day. If we have 10 such a devices it would result in 86400 items a day or 2678400 items a week. This would be to much data and is not usefull. To solve this problem we introduced the round_value key. Basically the round_value key will delete values that fall within a predefined range. An example explains this the best:

Below is a list of received values from a sensor:
1. 10
2. 11
3. 12
4. 9
5. 15
6. 16
7. 18
8. 19
9. 20

So lets see wath will happend if round_value is set to 2:

On step 1 and 2 the round value will do nothing as it needs at least 2 stored values to work.
On step 3 the round value will do its first action, it will see that the difference between value from step 1 is smaller or equal to round_value key, meaning that it will delete the value received in step 2.
On setp 4 it will kick in action again, at this point the data in the table is the folowing
* 10
* 12
The received value is 9, as the round_value is set to 2, it will not delete anything.
The same happend is step 5 and 6.
On step 7 the difference is again <= round_value, so the value received in step 6 is deleted.
So if we see whta data we will ahve after value 9 is received:

* 10
* 12
* 9
* 15
* 18
* 20

In this example this will save use 66% of storage space, so for the example in the beginning of this section we will go from 2678400 items a week to 1767744 items a week.

For this sytem to work its verry important that the round_value is set to a logical number for that type of sensor.
