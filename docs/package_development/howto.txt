How to create a package
=======================

First, what type of package do you want to create ?
===================================================
There are several types of packages :

* Plugins
* External members

Plugins
-------
A plugin is the main type of packages in Domogik. It allows you to use some devices (x10 gateway, Zwave stick, ...) or some software (web service, ...) in Domogik.

A plugin is made of :

* A json file which describes the plugin, the features, ...
* Some xml files to describe the way the database and the user interfaces will speak with the xPL network.
* Some python files.

External members
----------------
An external member is a xPL client not linked to Domogik. It can be a product like :

* The RFXCOM xPL.
* A sqeezebox.
* An DIY or arduino board with an ethernet shield and a sketch which speaks xPL.
* A xPL program made outside of Domogik (xpl-perl for example).

To interact with Domogik, some files must be created for an external member :

* A json file which describes the member and the features of the external member.
* Some xml files to describe the way the database and the user interfaces will speak with the xPL network.

.. warning ::
    Currently, for each external member you have to create some json and xml files. We will create a generic external member with some common features in order to handle some external members with classic features (temperature, ...). So, people won't have to create a package for each external client.

Then, how to create a package ?
===============================

Before creating the package
---------------------------

* Check if there is not already an existing (or in development) package for what you want to do.
* Look into the packages life cycle. **TODO : page liée**

Create the package
------------------

* Make specification for your package on the wiki. You can create a page wiki.domogik.org/<package type>/<package name>. Example : http://wiki.domogik.org/plugin_ipx800 for the *ipx800* plugin. **TODO : page liée**
* Start developing the package. **TODO : page liée**
* Write the package documentation at the same time. **TODO : page liée**
* Write some test cases for the package. **TODO : page liée**
* Test your package. **TODO : page liée**
* Generate the package and send a request to upload it on a repository. **TODO : page liée**
