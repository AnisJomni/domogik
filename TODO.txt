* Proposistion : rename "design" folder in "skins"
		 in "skins" folder, create "css" and "img" folders
		 under "templates", create "lang" and "js" folders
		 whith this, the application could be multilingual and skinnable (more simple too for developping UI interface).	

* General
	* @Loiz : set up internationalization for messages (see also how to translate data
		stored in the DB)
		For Django, see : http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/#topics-i18n

* UI		
	* @Epy : create a prototype using HTML / CSS
		Only two files to edit : base.html and style.css !
	* @Maxence : review model structure
	
	* Control
		* @Marc : Eventually create a global view that can switch off all the lights for example
		* @Marc : Display history of readings (essentially for sensors)
			Seems to be a good idea to use the powerful rrdtools : http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/gallery/index.en.html
		* @? : Add a function to schedule a task (eg. switch on/off the heating at a given time)

	* Admin
		* @Marc : In *Django's admin* interface, make possible to enter values for the device
		* @Marc : Add localization of the installation (Zip, City, Country) : useful for wheather forecasts

	* @? : find a way to switch between pure links and icons for the clickable areas (menus, functions...)
	* @? : Add facility to save / load scenes 

* mpris
	* @Maxence : create Mpris API in Python
    * @Maxence : create Mpris support to MPD (using python dbus/mpd libs)

* xPL
	* @Maxence : create fake components that simulate a real home automation network
		(useful to test the app without having any home automation installation)

* Website
	* @? : complete technical section
		* Write articles presenting the different technologies that can be used in home automation (X10, 1-Wire, PLCBus, IR, RFXCom, ...).
			The aim is just to give an overview and not an exhaustive documentation.
	* @Cyril : move README.txt content (installation process) on the web site, and translate it into french
	* @Marc : make sure articles are displayed in the right order
	* @Alban or @Marc : complete the "About us" section listing the main people managing / contributing to the project, and create other membrers profile
	* @Cyril : Translate into english the page explaining how to join the developper community (subversion)
	@ ? : Add screenshots of the new UI
