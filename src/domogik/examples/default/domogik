# -p to regulary ping plugins

# instance of each manager running.

#  - The database manager is not already running elsewhere on the network
#  - You do not pass -d parameter to the manager
MANAGER_PARAMS="-d -r -p -H"

# You can define one or many extra path(s) for Domogik startup scripts.
# This should only be useful if you use Domogik in developement mode (with setup.py develop)
# or if you have a custom path install.
# PATH is needed to locate 1 application :
#  - xPL_Hub : the xPL hub, *not* installed by setup.py develop
